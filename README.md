# Note Taker 

This is an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves notes from a JSON file.

The application’s front end was created by my instructors in the UofM FullStack Coding bootcamp. I built the back end, connected the two, and then deployed the entire application to Heroku.


WHEN You open the Note Taker app
You are presented with a landing page with a link to the notes page
WHEN you click on the link to the notes page
THEN you are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN you enter a new note title and the note’s text
A Save icon appears in the navigation at the top right of the page
WHEN you click on the Save icon
THEN the new note you just entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN you click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN you click on the plus icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN you are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
